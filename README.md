# Video-Sorter

A minimal, no fuss video viewer and sorter written in Python

# Motivation

I got tired of using VLC to sort through my video files, especially because it doesn't have the capacity to delete a file while viewing it. So I created my own video viewer and sorter.

# Features

- You can delete a file while viewing it
- Go forward/backwards in a folder
- Pause
- Fullscreen
- Replay
- Fast forward and backwards
- Autoplay
- Random on/off
- Timer
- Volume Control
- Mute

# Caveat

This won't replace a feature rich VLC or MPV but it's great for sorting videos
